SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: 
See also the online documentation for the Spring 2017 WXML course at the 
University of Washington at

as well as the main webpage for the results obtained with this software at 
http://www.math.washington.edu/wxml/tilings/. 

PURPOSE OF THE WXML TILINGS PROGRAMMING HOWTO: 

The purpose of this WXML project is to get users familiar with 
using Sage, the Sage Math Cloud, programming in Python, and 
running commands in a Linux terminal. To do this we will be 
using the existing source code base for the WXML Tilings Project 
available at http://www.math.washington.edu/wxml/tilings/. The 
best way to get familiar with programming in Python using Sage 
is by doing, so for the first few weeks we will be performing 
loose-deadline coding assignments with git run using the tilings 
program on the Sage Math Cloud terminal application.

Full solutions will be provided for a few good example tilings to 
get users familiar with the source code base for the tilings 
project and implementing these new tilings. After a few 
programming HOWTO sessions, the goal of this quarter's WXML 
project is to get each individual participating in the 
programming HOWTO to implement their own new tiling from the 
Tilings Encyclopedia (http://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/), 
which we may then include in the source code and listings 
on the WXML tilings website. 

Others are of course encouraged to use these 
materials to help improve their Sage and Python coding skills 
as well. Please contact me with your feedback if you work through the
programming HOWTOs and find the online content or software useful.
